offering an array of services that include e-Selling and e-Sourcing through online auction platform across \
diverse industry verticals and empowering businesses with greater process efficiencies.</p>\
<p>Today&acute;s economic trends have changed forcing many companies and individuals to downsize or \
reorganize their processes in order to meet their bottom line goals. We provide flexible end-to-end \
solutions that assist companies and individuals to meet their objectives by giving the best possible \
service at an affordable fee.</p><p>Regal Auction has been recently launched by a group of young entrepreneurs, \
with a vision to transform the supply chain management. We are dedicated to bring transparency, better \
process efficiencies and reduce cycle time in the process where goods and services are transacted.</p>

info.services.heading=Services
info.services.desc=<dl><dt>Reverse Auction</dt><dd>An online Purchase auction is a very effective tool \
in the hands of Materials/Purchase Department to reduce the Procurement cost in today&acute;s highly cost \
competitive environment. Typically, any high value Purchase, be it a Material, Project or a Service, \
one time or recurring, can be procured through an online bidding event. It brings about a great deal of \
transparency, competition through dynamic pricing, convenience and savings in time and life cycle cost \
for both the Buyer and the Seller.</dd><dt>Forward Auction</dt><dd>The e-Selling model of Regal Auction \
works as a 'disposal model' for Clients enabling higher price &amp; buyer discovery bringing in more \
efficiency, transparency &amp; convenience at each stage. Our experienced members recognize that sale \
of secondary/QC rejected products, asset, unused spares and scrap is always	unique - there is no single solution.</dd></dl>
